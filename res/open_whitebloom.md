# Open Whitebloom Specification

Whitebloom can be both an app and an open specification. The CoreData schema and module contract are already renderer-agnostic by design — no React Flow internals, no viewport state, no framework metadata. This document describes how to formalize that into a layered open spec so that different implementations (Electron app, web app, Tauri app, native app, LLM agent) can all operate on the same boards and share module logic.

## Layer 1: CoreData Spec

The file format. What exists on disk and what it means.

- **Workspace format.** A workspace is a directory containing a `.wbconfig` JSON file. `.wbconfig` holds workspace identity (`name`: the project name; `brief`: what the project is about in general) and per-workspace module overrides. Its presence is the workspace root marker. Empty workspaces (no boards) are valid. Current `.wbconfig` schema version is `1`.
- **Board format.** Any `*.wb.json` file in the workspace root is a board. The schema: `version`, `name`, `brief`, `nodes`, `edges`. Here `name` is the board's display label (shown in the workspace home screen and UI chrome) and `brief` is agent context specific to this board — what this board is for. Both are distinct from the workspace-level `name` and `brief` in `.wbconfig`; the file they appear in defines their scope. Boards are independent — any board can reference any workspace asset. Current board schema version is `3`.
- **Inbox format.** `<board-stem>.inbox.json` sits alongside its `*.wb.json` board file. It is a queue of agent proposals, each containing a `description`, a `rationale`, an `atomic` flag, and an array of serialized commands. This file is part of the spec — any compliant implementation must be able to read and write it.
- **Directory conventions.** `blossoms/` for assets whose primary creation and editing path is whitebloom (internal-default modules). `res/` for assets that originate outside whitebloom and open in native apps (external-default modules: images, video, spreadsheets, documents). Both directories are workspace-level — shared across all boards in the workspace. One file per asset. `res/.thumbs/` and `res/.inbox-snapshots/` hold auto-generated content; they are not part of the spec and should not be committed.
- **Resource URI scheme.** The `resource` field on a node is a URI string, not a raw path. Three schemes are defined: `wloc:` for workspace-local files (e.g. `wloc:blossoms/research.md`, resolved relative to the workspace root); `file:///` for absolute filesystem paths to files outside the workspace; `https://` for web resources (future). The `wloc:` scheme has no authority component — the path follows the colon directly.
- **Node semantics.** Buds (bloomable, always have a `resource`) vs leaves (inline, do not bloom).
- **Field reference.** Board fields: `version`, `name` (board display label), `brief` (board-scoped agent context), `nodes`, `edges`. These share field names with `.wbconfig` fields (`name`, `brief`) but carry board-scoped meaning; the file determines the scope. Node fields: `id`, `kind`, `type`, `position`, `size`, `created`, `createdBy`, `updatedAt`, `updatedBy`, `label`, `content`, `resource`. Edge fields: `id`, `from`, `to`, `label`. The `type` field on a bud is the claiming module's `id` (e.g. `"com.whitebloom.focus-writer"`) for concrete-typed buds, or `null` for void-typed buds whose handler is resolved at open-time from the file extension.
- **Error nodes.** When any node fails to render (missing file, module crash, unresolvable URI), the canvas replaces it in-place with a generic error node — same position, same size, no board data modified. Error nodes are a runtime UI state only; the board JSON is unchanged. Distinct from unknown-type nodes (module not installed): unknown type is a valid quiescent state resolved by installing the module; an error node means something went wrong at render time.
- **Standalone boards.** A `*.wb.json` file in a directory without `.wbconfig` is a standalone board (informally: quickboard). It uses the same board format but only `file:///` and `https://` URIs are valid — no `wloc:` (no workspace root to resolve against), no blossoms. Standalone boards can be promoted to a workspace via a one-way *Promote to Workspace* operation that copies all linked assets into `res/` or `blossoms/`, rewrites their URIs to `wloc:`, and writes a `.wbconfig`. The inverse (workspace → standalone) is not supported: the transformation is lossy and has no unambiguous inverse.
- **Versioning.** Two independent version fields: `version` in `.wbconfig` (workspace schema version, currently `1`) and `version` in `*.wb.json` (board schema version, currently `3`). Changing either schema is a breaking change.

The user model remains app-level, not board-level or workspace-level, in v3. The board stores only string provenance fields on nodes; richer user data such as avatars or email belongs in app settings or a future identity layer, not in the board or workspace manifest.

This layer is inert data. Any tool that can read JSON and traverse a directory can consume it. No behavior, no runtime, no framework.


## Layer 2: Host-Editor Protocol (HEP)

How any consumer — UI editor, LLM agent, CLI tool — interacts with bud data. This is the contract that makes an LLM agent and a React editor equivalent citizens. Both speak HEP. One renders pixels, the other emits text.

### Semantics (not transport)

The spec defines what these operations *mean* — ordering guarantees, conflict behavior, lock semantics — not how bytes move. An Electron viewer implements HEP over IPC. A web app implements it over HTTP. An LLM agent implements it over direct filesystem access.

```ts
interface HostEditorProtocol<T> {
  read(resource: string): Promise<T>
  save(resource: string, data: T): Promise<void>
  watch(resource: string, cb: (data: T) => void): Unsubscribe
  enqueueProposal(boardPath: string, proposal: Proposal): Promise<void>
}
```

### What HEP covers

- **Read/save contract.** How a consumer reads bud data and writes it back. Serialization format per file extension.
- **Watch/change notification.** How a consumer learns that an external actor modified a resource. This is the coupling point between native apps and the board: when a user edits a `.xlsx` in Excel and saves, the file watcher fires, the board thumbnail refreshes, and agent shells pick up the change. Watch is not optional for external-default modules.
- **Proposal inbox protocol.** How an agent submits write proposals rather than writing directly. Agents call `enqueueProposal`, which appends to the board's `<board-stem>.inbox.json` file alongside the board. The app polls the inbox and surfaces proposals to the user as ghost elements on the canvas. See the inbox system section in `whitebloom.md` for the full proposal schema, visual treatment, keyboard review flow, and diff/clone semantics.
- **Type discovery.** How a consumer determines what type a bud is and whether a handler is available.
- **Diffable interface.** The framework-independent data contract (`Diffable<T>`) that CoreAssets and modules implement to enable structured diffs in the proposal review UI. `diff(before, after): DiffResult` is pure data; the view (`DiffView`) lives in the framework binding at Layer 3.
- **Shell protocol.** How an agent discovers and consumes a module's agentic interface — reading `module_agents.md`, listing available lenses, invoking skills.

### Why this layer exists separately

Without HEP as its own layer, the read/save contract lives inside a framework-specific binding spec. An LLM agent would either depend on a React spec it doesn't use, or reinvent the IO contract ad hoc. HEP ensures the protocol is shared and the agent is a first-class consumer by construction, not by accident.

### Module data contract

The framework-independent parts of a module belong here:

- `id` — unique identifier (e.g. `"com.whitebloom.focus-writer"`). For specific modules, this is what gets stamped as the board node's `type` when the module claims a file on drag-and-drop or creates a bud via the palette.
- `extensions` — array of file extensions handled, e.g. `[".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".webp"]`. Multiple modules may declare the same extensions — there is no exclusive ownership.
- `defaultRenderer` — `'internal'` or `'external'`. Declares whether the bloom action opens an in-app editor or the OS default app. Overridable per module in `.wbconfig`.
- `importable?: false` — optional. When present, permanently opts the module out of copy-into-workspace behavior. The UI suppresses all import affordances (settings toggle, "Import to Local" context action, copy-on-drop) for this module's resources. Omitting the field means importable. Use for opaque directories or assets where copying would be harmful or meaningless — Obsidian vaults, `.blend` files, shared team project folders.
- `recognizes?(resource)` — optional. When present, marks the module as *specific*: it inspects the file on drag-and-drop (minimally — a header, a top-level field) and returns `true` if the file belongs to its domain. On a `true` result, the module's `id` is stamped as the board node's `type`. When absent, the module is *generic*: it handles any file of its declared extensions, but never stamps a type. Void-typed buds (`type: null`) are opened by generic modules.
- `createDefault?()` — optional. Returns default data for a new bud created via the palette. External modules that reference existing files omit this.

### Shell contract

The agentic interface is defined entirely at the HEP layer — it has no framework dependency. A shell is a directory of files:

- `agents/module_agents.md` — agent-facing description of the asset type
- `agents/lenses/*.lens.json` — interpretive frames (see `whitebloom.md` for full lens spec)
- `agents/skills/*` — operational tools for surgical editing

Shells are portable across all domain bindings. A shell written for a React app works identically in a Tauri app, a CLI tool, or a standalone LLM agent. This is the key payoff of the three-layer architecture — the agentic interface never touches Layer 3.


## Layer 3: Domain Bindings

Framework-specific specs that translate HEP into the platform's component model. Each binding spec is thin — mostly mapping `read/save` to props, stores, or IPC calls. Only **editors** and other host-specific UI surfaces live at this layer. Shells (lenses, skills, agent notes) are defined at Layer 2 and are shared across all bindings.

App-specific organizational surfaces such as Whitebloom's Arrangements desktop also belong here. They may introduce useful product concepts such as "material" (file-backed workspace items) versus canvas-local leaves, but they do not alter CoreData, HEP, or module packaging unless they become true cross-implementation requirements.

### Structure

```
Whitebloom React Binding Spec
  ├── WhitebloomEditor<T>: React component with BudEditorProps<T>
  ├── Thumbnail component contract (future)
  └── @whitebloom/ui CSS variable contract

Whitebloom Svelte Binding Spec
  ├── WhitebloomEditor<T>: Svelte component with equivalent props
  └── UI kit conventions

Whitebloom Native Binding Spec
  ├── WhitebloomEditor<T>: embedded view (C++/Qt, etc.)
  └── IPC protocol mapping for read/save
```

Binding specs are community-driven. Whoever builds a viewer for a new platform writes the binding spec. The core spec, HEP, and all shells work unchanged across every binding. Product-specific workspace UX may vary substantially between bindings without fragmenting the open spec.


## Module packaging

A symbiotic module ships as a single package with layers separated:

```
whitebloom-focus-writer/       # internal-default, specific module
  core/         # extensions: [".md"], recognizes(), createDefault() — CoreData level
  agents/       # Shell — lenses, skills, module_agents.md — HEP level
  protocol/     # read/save handlers — HEP level
  react/        # Editor component — React binding
  svelte/       # Editor component — Svelte binding

whitebloom-image/              # external-default, generic module
  core/         # extensions: [".jpg",".jpeg",".png",".webp",...], no recognizes()
                # defaultRenderer: 'external' — generic handler, no type stamped
  agents/       # Shell — lenses for agent image description, alt-text skill
  protocol/     # read() returns parsed metadata (dimensions, EXIF, etc.)
  # no react/ or svelte/ needed — bloom action calls openExternal
```

- An LLM agent imports `core/`, `protocol/`, and `agents/`.
- A React viewer imports `core/`, `protocol/`, `agents/`, and `react/`.
- A Svelte viewer imports `core/`, `protocol/`, `agents/`, and `svelte/`.
- An external-default module omits framework bindings entirely — the bloom action is handled by the host, not the module.

Shared logic is not duplicated. UI is swappable. The shell (`agents/`) is universal.

Because editors and shells are independently resolvable, a module author can also ship them as separate packages entirely. A security researcher can publish a standalone shell package with lenses and skills, without writing a single UI component. A UI developer can publish a polished editor, without thinking about agents. A domain expert can publish a single lens file.


## Governance

The CoreData spec and HEP (including the shell contract and lens format) are the load-bearing parts — worth stewarding by a consortium or standards body. Binding specs can be submitted by community implementors and blessed if they're consistent with the core layers.

The handoff is natural: the core spec stabilizes first, the reference implementation (the Electron app) validates it, the LLM agent integration validates the shell/lens boundary, and binding specs emerge as new viewers are built.
